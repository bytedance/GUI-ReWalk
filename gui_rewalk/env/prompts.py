- Do not keep repeating the prediction of the same action. If you notice that the historical actions have caused no obvious changes to the screenshots (except for the time display), you need to first figure out why the historical actions failed to bring about changes, and then predict the current action.

for example, format as:
```
{
  "action_type": "MOUSE_MOVE",
  "x": 1319.11,
  "y": 65.06
}
```
- For [CLICK, MOUSE_DOWN, MOUSE_UP], you need to specify the click_type as well, select from [LEFT, MIDDLE, RIGHT, WHEEL_UP, WHEEL_DOWN], which means you click the left button, middle button, right button, wheel up or wheel down of your mouse:
for example, format as:
```
{
  "action_type": "CLICK",
  "click_type": "LEFT"
}
```
- For [KEY, KEY_DOWN, KEY_UP], you need to choose a(multiple) key(s) from the keyboard
for example, format as:
```
{
  "action_type": "KEY",
  "key": "ctrl+c"
}
```
- For TYPE, you need to specify the text you want to type
for example, format as:
```
{
  "action_type": "TYPE",
  "text": "hello world"
}
```

REMEMBER:
For every step, you should only RETURN ME THE action_type AND parameters I ASKED FOR. NEVER EVER RETURN ME ANYTHING ELSE.
You MUST wrap the dict with backticks (`).
You MUST choose and ONLY CHOOSE from the action space above, otherwise your action will be considered as invalid and you will get a penalty.
You CAN predict multiple actions at one step, but you should only return one action for each step.

for example, format as:
```
{
  "action_type": "MOUSE_MOVE",

}
```
- For [CLICK, MOUSE_DOWN, MOUSE_UP], you need to specify the click_type as well, select from [LEFT, MIDDLE, RIGHT, WHEEL_UP, WHEEL_DOWN], which means you click the left button, middle button, right button, wheel up or wheel down of your mouse:
for example, format as:
```
{
  "action_type": "CLICK",
  "click_type": "LEFT"
}
```
- For [KEY, KEY_DOWN, KEY_UP], you need to choose a(multiple) key(s) from the keyboard
for example, format as:
```
{
  "action_type": "KEY",
  "key": "ctrl+c"

- For TYPE, you need to specify the text you want to type
for example, format as:
```

Firstly you need to predict the class of your action, then you need to predict the parameters of your action:
- For MOUSE_MOVE, you need to predict the x and y coordinate of the mouse cursor, the left top corner of the screen is (0, 0), the right bottom corner of the screen is (1920, 1080)
for example, format as:
```
{
  "action_type": "MOUSE_MOVE",
  "x": 1319.11,
  "y": 65.06
}
```
- For [CLICK, MOUSE_DOWN, MOUSE_UP], you need to specify the click_type as well, select from [LEFT, MIDDLE, RIGHT, WHEEL_UP, WHEEL_DOWN], which means you click the left button, middle button, right button, wheel up or wheel down of your mouse:
for example, format as:
```
{
  "action_type": "CLICK",
  "click_type": "LEFT"
}
```
- For [KEY, KEY_DOWN, KEY_UP], you need to choose a(multiple) key(s) from the keyboard
for example, format as:
```
{
  "action_type": "KEY",
  "key": "ctrl+c"
}
```
- For TYPE, you need to specify the text you want to type
for example, format as:
```
{
  "action_type": "TYPE",
  "text": "hello world"
}
```

REMEMBER:
For every step, you should only RETURN ME THE action_type AND parameters I ASKED FOR. NEVER EVER RETURN ME ANYTHING ELSE.
You MUST wrap the dict with backticks (`).
You MUST choose and ONLY CHOOSE from the action space above, otherwise your action will be considered as invalid and you will get a penalty.
You CAN predict multiple actions at one step, but you should only return one action for each step.

```python
pyautogui.moveTo(tag_3)

pyautogui.dragTo(tag_1, button='left')
```
When you think you can directly output precise x and y coordinates or there is no tag on which you want to interact, you can also use them directly. 
But you should be careful to ensure that the coordinates are correct.
Return one line or multiple lines of python code to perform the action each time, be time efficient. When predicting multiple lines of code, make some small sleep like `time.sleep(0.5);` interval so that the machine could take; Each time you need to predict a complete code, no variables or function can be shared from history

Follow the following guidance to think step by step before outlining the next action step at the current stage:

(Current Screenshot Identification)
Firstly, think about what the current screenshot is.

(Previous Action Analysis)
Secondly, combined with the screenshot, analyze each step of the previous action history and their intention one by one. Particularly, pay more attention to the last step, which may be more related to what you should do now as the next step.

(Screenshot Details Analysis)
Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the webpage to understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. You should closely examine the screenshot details to see what steps have been completed by previous actions even though you are given the textual previous actions. Because the textual history may not clearly and sufficiently record some effects of previous actions, you should closely evaluate the status of every part of the webpage to understand what you have done.

(Next Action Based on Screenshot and Analysis)
Then, based on your analysis, in conjunction with human desktop using habits and the logic of app GUI design, decide on the following action. And clearly outline which button in the screenshot users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

You have good knowledge of computer and good internet connection and assume your code will run on a computer for controlling the mouse and keyboard.
You are on Ubuntu operating system and the resolution of the screen is 1920x1080.
For each step, you will get an observation of an image, which is the screenshot of the computer screen and you will predict the action of the computer based on the image.
The following rules are IMPORTANT:
- If previous actions didn't achieve the expected result, do not repeat them, especially the last one. Try to adjust either the coordinate or the action based on the new screenshot.
- Do not predict multiple clicks at once. Base each action on the current screenshot; do not predict actions for elements or events not yet visible in the screenshot.
- You cannot complete the task by outputting text content in your response. You must use mouse and keyboard to interact with the computer. Return ```Fail``` when you think the task can not be done.

You should provide a detailed observation of the current computer state based on the full screenshot in detail in the "Observation:" section.
Provide any information that is possibly relevant to achieving the task goal and any elements that may affect the task execution, such as pop-ups, notifications, error messages, loading states, etc..
You MUST return the observation before the thought.

You should think step by step and provide a detailed thought process before generating the next action:
Thought:
- Step by Step Progress Assessment:
  - Analyze completed task parts and their contribution to the overall goal
  - Reflect on potential errors, unexpected results, or obstacles
  - If previous action was incorrect, predict a logical recovery step
- Next Action Analysis:
  - List possible next actions based on current state
  - Evaluate options considering current state and previous actions
  - Propose most logical next action
  - Anticipate consequences of the proposed action
Your thought should be returned in "Thought:" section. You MUST return the thought before the code.

You are required to use `pyautogui` to perform the action grounded to the observation, but DONOT use the `pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen` function to locate the element you want to operate with since we have no image of the element you want to operate with. DONOT USE `pyautogui.screenshot()` to make screenshot.
Return exactly ONE line of python code to perform the action each time. At each step, you MUST generate the corresponding instruction to the code before a # in a comment (example: # Click \"Yes, I trust the authors\" button\npyautogui.click(x=0, y=0, duration=1)\n)
For the instruction you can decribe the element you want to interact with in detail including the visual description and function description. And make it clear and concise.
For example you can describe what the element looks like, and what will be the expected result when you interact with it.
You need to to specify the coordinates of by yourself based on your observation of current observation, but you should be careful to ensure that the coordinates are correct.
Remember you should only return ONE line of code, DO NOT RETURN more. You should return the code inside a code block, like this:
```python
# your code here
```
Specially, it is also allowed to return the following special code:
When you think you have to wait for some time, return ```WAIT```;
When you think the task can not be done, return ```FAIL```, don't easily say ```FAIL```, try your best to do the task;
When you think the task is done, return ```DONE```.

For your reference, you have maximum of 100 steps, and current step is {current_step} out of {max_steps}.
If you are in the last step, you should return ```DONE``` or ```FAIL``` according to the result.

Here are some guidelines for you:
1. Remember to generate the corresponding instruction to the code before a # in a comment and only return ONE line of code.
2. If a click action is needed, use only the following functions: pyautogui.click, pyautogui.rightClick or pyautogui.doubleClick.
3. Return ```Done``` when you think the task is done. Return ```Fail``` when you think the task can not be done.

My computer's password is 'password', feel free to use it when you need sudo rights.
First give the current screenshot and previous things we did a short reflection, then RETURN ME THE CODE OR SPECIAL CODE I ASKED FOR NEVER EVER RETURN ME ANYTHING ELSE.

GUIDANCE = (
    'Here are some useful guidelines you need to follow:\n'
    'General:\n'
    '- Usually there will be multiple ways to complete a task, pick the'
    ' easiest one. Also when something does not work as expected (due'
    ' to various reasons), sometimes a simple retry can solve the problem,'
    " but if it doesn't (you can see that from the history),"
    ' SWITCH to other solutions.\n'
    '- Sometimes you may need to navigate the phone to gather information'
    ' needed to complete the task, for example if user asks'
    ' "what is my schedule tomorrow", then you may want to open the calendar'
    ' app (using the `open_app` action), look up information there, answer'
    " user's question (using the `answer` action) and finish (using"
    ' the `status` action with complete as goal_status).\n'
    '- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use'
    ' the `answer` action to reply to user explicitly before finish!'
    ' Merely displaying the answer on the screen is NOT sufficient (unless'
    ' the goal is something like "show me ...").\n'
    '- If the desired state is already achieved (e.g., enabling Wi-Fi when'
    " it's already on), you can just complete the task.\n"
    'Action Related:\n'
    '- Use the `open_app` action whenever you want to open an app'
    ' (nothing will happen if the app is not installed), do not use the'
    ' app drawer to open an app unless all other ways have failed.\n'
    '- Use the `input_text` action whenever you want to type'
    ' something (including password) instead of clicking characters on the'
    ' keyboard one by one. Sometimes there is some default text in the text'
    ' field you want to type in, remember to delete them before typing.\n'
    '- For `click`, `long_press` and `input_text`, the index parameter you'
    ' pick must be VISIBLE in the screenshot and also in the UI element'
    ' list given to you (some elements in the list may NOT be visible on'
    ' the screen so you can not interact with them).\n'
    '- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll`'
    ' action with different directions to reveal additional content.\n'
    '- The direction parameter for the `scroll` action can be confusing'
    " sometimes as it's opposite to swipe, for example, to view content at the"
    ' bottom, the `scroll` direction should be set to "down". It has been'
    ' observed that you have difficulties in choosing the correct direction, so'
    ' if one does not work, try the opposite as well.\n'
    'Text Related Operations:\n'
    '- Normally to select certain text on the screen: <i> Enter text selection'
    ' mode by long pressing the area where the text is, then some of the words'
    ' near the long press point will be selected (highlighted with two pointers'
    ' indicating the range) and usually a text selection bar will also appear'
    ' with options like `copy`, `paste`, `select all`, etc.'
    ' <ii> Select the exact text you need. Usually the text selected from the'
    ' previous step is NOT the one you want, you need to adjust the'
    ' range by dragging the two pointers. If you want to select all text in'
    ' the text field, simply click the `select all` button in the bar.\n'
    "- At this point, you don't have the ability to drag something around the"
    ' screen, so in general you can not select arbitrary text.\n'
    '- To delete some text: the most traditional way is to place the cursor'
    ' at the right place and use the backspace button in the keyboard to'
    ' delete the characters one by one (can long press the backspace to'
    ' accelerate if there are many to delete). Another approach is to first'
    ' select the text you want to delete, then click the backspace button'
    ' in the keyboard.\n'
    '- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which'
    ' usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy`'
    ' button in bar.\n'
    '- To paste text into a text box, first long press the'
    ' text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a'
    ' `paste` button in it.\n'
    '- When typing into a text field, sometimes an auto-complete dropdown'
    ' list will appear. This usually indicating this is a enum field and you'
    ' should try to select the best match by clicking the corresponding one'
    ' in the list.\n'
